description: "Strange giant activity brings our heroes together"
---

Reports of unusual giant activity bring our adventurers to Nightstone, a small village in the Sword Coast. The normally reclusive giants have become increasingly aggressive, attacking settlements without apparent reason. As our heroes gather in the local inn, they share tales of giant sightings and discuss the growing threat to the realm.
