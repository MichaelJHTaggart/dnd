Abraham shoots the vampire dragonborn woman, but not much damage seems to have happened. Kigee attempted to talk to her, but she did not respond. She ran upstairs and we hear noise, as a huge swarm of rats come running down the stairs. We kill some of the rats, but not all, and we hear glass break upstairs. Abraham, Diedrik, Thalindra, and Strahd head outside with the parents, as Kigee heads upstairs to prepare to burn down the Ol' Bonegrinder. She finds 5 kids in cages, as well as 3 properly hatched dragonborn eggs, and a number of failed eggs. No idea how she fertilized them, and a broken window where she seemingly escaped. We burn the inside of the Ol' Bonegrinder with plans to return to blow it up later. We return to Van Richten's tower and make plans for the next day for Abraham and Thalindra to do some shopping for the group, collecting items for the new family to create a homestead. The kids are traumatized and are in a state of disassociation. The woman doesnt speak, but helps witht he kids and cleaning, and the man is coherent enough to talk to. We learn from him that the dragonborn vampire woman wasn't the one cooking the kids, it was a woman called Baba Lysaga - Strahd's nursemaid that is a witch from the bog, that travels in a moving hut. The dragonborn vampire woman only prevented the couple from moving upstairs, and have no memory of being bitten. There's hope that mother isn't evil! Strahd tells us that Baba Lysaga has a CR rating of 11, and we are not yet ready to face her. For the next session, we plan on continuing to turn the tower to a homestead, by building a shed for the cart and horse drawn plow, possibly building a normal door, and helping create the garden. Kigee and the woman make the family more clothes and bedrolls and such.
