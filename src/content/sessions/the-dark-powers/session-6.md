Realization settles in that Borris is no longer. Diedrik prays, Kigee beats on Strahd with her human hands before crying, and Thalindra is sweeping some of the ashes into a jar. Inside of the armoire, is books and jars and little things like that. Strahd explains that a feygod has achieved great powers and that is why we need to stop them. Strahd leads us back to the mausoleum after collecting a small amount of each of our blood. We go back down to where we found Strahd, and he goes to the extra coffin that is within the space, that is being held open with locks. He opens the top of it, leaving the bottom locked, a mist rolls out stinking of old death. Strahd sticks the flask of blood into the mouth of the creature laying within the coffin. He sits up and smells Strahd (human), Werewolf, and WereRaven, and whatever Thalindra is. Dragonborn. The creature coming out of the coffin is undead but human. He's pale, gaunt, and glowing red eyes. He is dressed in riding gear, with a chain shirt, and a long sword at his side. As he stands, small crystals clank to the ground. Strahd picks them up, and hands them out to us. Diedrik is a druid (I didn't write the cool bit ðŸ˜¦ )Kigee has the feeling of knowledge embed into her. Knowledge of tracking, and prey, as well as knowing details of weak points. Thalindra discovers the powers within her blood, and has the ability to wield magic. Strahd melts a stone in his palm. Thalindra grabs a health potion on the way out. As we leave, 3 devilish-looking gargoyles are blocking our path. Our new friend Abraham pulls out strange contraptions that go BOOM! and shoots them with pistols.

We destroy them, and get Thalindra covered in dust. Abraham appears to be healing, she asks if he is a vamp and he says yes, by the hand of Strahd. Strahd mentions an item that could cure his vampirism, a ring that grants one wish. Diedrik transformed back to human, and hands Kigee 10 berries. Except theyre goodberries, so shes instantly OVER full and falls to the ground again. Strahd picks her up and leads the group to town, and rents an inn for the group. We arrive in the middle of the night. Reminder, Kigee is in hybrid.
