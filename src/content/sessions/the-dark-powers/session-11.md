As the group walks, heading for Van Richten's Tower. Kigee has a moment with Diedrik, and they apologize for their part in their previous fight. As they talk, Kigee sees some movement, and Abraham checks it out. The creature jumps up and tries to shoot a needle at Abraham but misses. Kigee kills the one that went for Abraham, and 13 of them jump up and all shoot Kigee, causing her to fall unconscious. The fight commences, the plant people perish easily, but their needles pack a heck of a punch. Diedrik casts a spell to stabilize and save her life, before covering her unconscious body with his own. The plant people turn their attention to Diedrik, and take him out as well. Abraham takes a stand and attracts the attention on him, taking out many of them while also tanking majority of the damage to protect everyone. Strahd saves Diedrik, and Diedrik saves Kigee, who breaks her hand crossbow as she stands. Diedrik notes that as the last creature flees, we are covered in pollen. It appears that it will attract the violence of future plants. Thalindra washes the pollen off of all of us, and we continue on. As we walk, Kigee asks Abraham about how he became a vampire. Strahd admits that he has a wish spell, his last wish spell, in a ring and offers it to Abraham, who immediately uses it to turn human. Woah. After an emotional moment, we continue on. As we pass the Old Bonegrinder, feeling evil and death, we learn of the lore behind the hags and human meat pies, and wonder if we should burn the building. Diedrik scopes it out in his wolf form, and he startles the homeless family that has been using it as a home. Kigee tries to play it off that he's a pup, but fails to pacify the family, so we let them be. We get to the top of a hill and see Vallaki ahead, but also see it is nearly sunrise. So we make a cute picnic and watch the sun rise, eating rabbits from Abraham's hat and drinking Kigee's family wine, enjoying life.

Until the mist returns, and the rain comes. We move onto Vallaki, with Diedrik in his human form. As we approach, we learn that the guards are requiring blood tests, as there was a werewolf attack recently. We retreat suspiciously because we suck, and discuss why that could be. Possibly the wolves were chased out of the forest by plants, or they were charmed to attack once they got into the city, we aren't sure. The group decides to continue to Argynvastholt, while Kigee does a quick trip to her family's home to warn them about the blood test, with promise to meet as the group arrives at Argynvastholt. As Kigee flies away, she is struck by lightning and falls to the ground, unconscious. The rest of the group arrives at Argynvastholt, and pulls out some everburning torches.

Kigee wakes up, and tries to move but is unable. She is manacled to a huge tree, surrounded by shamanistic druids who are dancing and chanting, wearing rotten flesh. Sharp thorny vines are climbing the tree towards her, and we leave off!
