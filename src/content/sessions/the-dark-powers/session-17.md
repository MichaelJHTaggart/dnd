The adventureres are woken up by Diedrik who leads them outside per their now morning ritual, and they get 7 temporary hit points. The group heads for Tser Falls as planned, leaving Strahd at home. The ol bonegrinder is now just woods, with the trees having creepy faces on them. We continue, and as we arrive, we see at the top of Tser falls, a cabin. We approach, and we peak through the crack in the door, to see Thalindra's vampire mother setting up 3 plates on the table. Thalindra knocks on the door and her mother summons us inside. Everyone begins to eat the delicious food. Kigee attempts to resist eating the food but she can't help but eat the food. The food make us drowsy and we are led to a bedroom where we can't help but fall asleep. During dinner we learn that perhaps we should check out the Amber Temple when we are strong enough to gain knowledge of defeating the evil that has taken over Borovia. We wake and there is delicious food set out again at the table. Thalindra's mother is no where to be found. We are not compelled to eat this time, but it is delicious. Thalindra, Kigee, and Abraham look around the home. They find that Thalindra's mother cared deeply about her children and loved them. Remnants of their shells from their eggs, hand made play clothes, and beds with their names on them all of which are well preserved and taken care of. They go outside to where Diedrik is barking, and try to find out where Thalindra's mom is. At Thalindra's prompting Diedrik transforms into a rat and checks under the house for a lair, he finds a small building in the back and the party investigates. Its an outhouse and the party opens it and finds stairs leading down. Kigee pushes Thalindra forward to prompt her to go first; However, the push unintentionally sends Thalindra falling down the 30 foot stairs and getting seriously injured. Kigee apologizes, Diedrik heals her, and the party decides to investigate this large cavern. They discover creatures that burrow through stone reside here. The heroes decide to travel in the wide and endless cavern. After a days journey they prepare, cook, and eat some rabbits when suddenly the ground tremors and the party sees 2 Umber Hulks pop out of the ground 50 feet away.
