After waiting in the common area of the inn for at least an hour for Strahd, we get a bit fed up of waiting. Kigee knocks on his door, it swings open and she sees Strahd's room is a mess, with his weapons and armour still there, with a small amount of blood on the window sill. She comes back to tell the guys, and they rush up to check things out. It was obvious there was a struggle, and slash marks on the bed posts and window sill. (4 slashes in a diagonal angle). Abraham finds the blood to be human, and Diedrik determines a human can't climb up to this window. Diedrik goes downstairs to collect Kigee, catching her finishing the drink Abraham had been "drinking" earlier. When they return to Strahd's room, Diedrik chews out Kigee and calls her vain (both in looks and personality), before asking if a Wereraven could have made these marks. No. Werewolf? No. Strahd's sword? No, still too big. Possibly a scarecrow with murder fingers. Diedrik takes Strahd's armor and sword, and heads outside to check that side of things. Abraham goes out the window, Diedrik walks down the stairs, and Kigee stays behind to do a look around. She finds a key! Abraham finds a boot mark with a pattern and a scent of hay. Diedrik checks the perimeter and picks up the scent of Strahd, and blood. He transforms back into a human and we have a discussion. Kigee tries to check the area as a bird but gets distracted by the armour of Strahd and doesnt see much. Diedrik turns back into the wolf, and continues to follow the blood. We stumble across vine-wrapped, pumpkin headed scarecrows with fire in their insides, dancing around a limp body.
