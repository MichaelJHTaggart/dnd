As Boris pays and thanks the barkeep, who warns Boris to be careful, as a howl is heard in the distance. Kigee finishes putting the wine cart away and comes inside moaning about the wet. As the howls sound, Diedrik laughs and says "The kitties are out" in reference to the wolves. Kigee buys Boris a drink, totally willingly, and we overhear a conversation. "Did you hear about the Strieth kid? walked into the woods and never came back." The child in question is of the local hat maker. We head into the woods. As we walk, we notice the creepy scarecrows. Some were normalish, some had MURDER FINGERS. Like, scythes for fingers. We hear a wolf howl behind us towards town, and we hear a response in front of us where we expect the child to be, no turning back now! Heading in towards where we hear the child crying, we round a tree and see the child is stuck in a bear trap, it's leg is crushed. Borris and Diedrik pry open the trap and Kigee pulls the kid out, puts it on her back, then took off running. A wolf appears, and both Borris and Diedrik fight it off. As it flees, a giant form appears out of NOWHERE and attacks Diedrik, taking a massive chunk out of his face. Afterwords it takes off, and we flee to Borris' people to seek healers. Diedrik healed stupid fast, Borris and I talked to the Seeir who told of of our fate, and made it clear she knew what Kigee was. Kigee is freaked and tries to leave while Borris sees the healer. Diedrik stops Kigee from leaving and dying to MURDER FINGERS. He gathers raw chickens and eats them, Kigee tries to stop him but he growled at her. She hides in her wagon and finds a TON of metal buttons ❤️ We all wake, and holy heck theres a wolf in the camp! Kigee tries to sneak away but it catches her and barks and wags its tail. Borris convinces her to come out, and we grab the kid and gather our reward.
