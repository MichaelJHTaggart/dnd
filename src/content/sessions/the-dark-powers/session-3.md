Kigee and Borris discuss next steps, and she insults him before heading into the bar to wait for Diedrik, but mostly to wait for the rain to clear out.  Borris tries to leave the pup (Diedrik) outside, pup panicks and starts dancing, drawing in a crowd. Kigee drinks too much and forgets to eat dinner first, ends up white girl wasted. Kigee is led upstairs to sleep it off, and Borris discovers that the pup can understand common! After Diedrik was misunderstood completely, Borris and Pup head to Borris' wagon to sleep the evening away. As we very sleepily wake, we converge together sleepily. Almost euphoric as we head towards a large castle. Diedrik is in his werewolf form and Kigee is in her hybrid form, none of us knowing who is each other. We end up walking towards a mausoleum. Standing next to a large coffin, we see a man in his 30s with long slicked black hair and his features are strangely indistinct. His fine clothes are tatters around him. "Thank you for answering my summons. In my life, I was once a great warrior. Jealousy has put me on a path i cant reconcile. I committed horrible sins and I was bound to this land forever. Hundreds of years I was a monster, but the saint marchovia has given me another chance, with your help." He pats a book on the coffin "In here are instructions to bring me back to fight against the new evil that befalls this land. Please help me."

We wake, I don't remember getting to this bed, and my feet are muddy and I'm in my were form. Diedrik wakes in his were form, rousing himself under the cart, the people around are screaming, which wakes Borris. Borris and other men are wielding weapons and making a call of "Werewolf"! The beast speaks, and Borris makes the connection that this is Diedrik. Borris suggests that we see Olga, and we hear a voice that says "Yes, bring the dog and the bird". We go to see her, and she comes out with a table to give us another tarot reading. Basically she reiterates what we learned in the dream, and asks us to help the monster Strahd. Kigee tries to help Diedrik shift back into human, but he's a noob at shifting so that doesn't work. Diedrik takes off to go hunt a deer. As we return to the inn to collect Kigee's wine cart, we see wierd brain creatures running around, and a mist that has settled over the ground. On arrival, the cart is completely destroyed and the horses are no where to be seen. A gross green creature is laying dead nearby, and we hear chuckles coming from the woods, with many eyes staring at us. Diedrik returns covered in deer blood, holy hell!
