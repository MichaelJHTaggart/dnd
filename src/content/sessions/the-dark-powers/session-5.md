Walls of Castle ravenloft are covered with strange ivy with flowers larger that we've seen on other ivy. As we arrive, the "guard trees" don't move. They are rooted, and stand about 24-25' tall. As we enter, we see shadows in the shape of kids, with the sound of children echoing through the halls. A slight breeze that is damp and cold filters through, while the outdoors was warm. Kigee confidently goes to the door on the left and grabs the door handle, disappearing from the view of the others. The door does open with a loud squeal. In actuality, a trap door opened under her and she went down a slide and plopped into a large cooking pot. The guys come up to the open door, and dont see Kigee but they hear the baby crying again. As they enter the room, they see a dusty bottle with a red liquid, a stark contrast to the rest, and a doll in the middle of the room that moves.

Kigee tries to swim to the edge and tries to climb out, but slips on the edges when Borris joins her. A whoosh sounds and the pot lights up with what appears to be fire, and the bottom begins to get warm. Borris climbs up but slips back in, however he sees rat-like things, with one chopping an onion. Kigee transforms into her hybrid form SURPRISING THE HECK OUT OF BORRIS FOR SURE and lifts Borris out of the pot, before flying out herself. Borris picks up a 2 handed cleaver, and the rats scatter, screaming about an intruder. Cut to Diedrik, he's terrified about suddenly being alone. He freezes in place, listening to the enviorment. Jump to Thalindra, and she's in a graveyard. She's used to the sound of crying children, but suddenly she hears the whimpering sounds of an adult through an open door to the castle. As she enters, she sees a man standing totally still, whimpering quietly to himself. She asks if he's okay, as she comes through the door to the right. Untouched so far is a door to the back and stairs going up. They agree to look for the missing companions, and Thalindra points out she has never seen that door open before. Diedrik whips around and sees that the doll is gone. Thalindra picks up the vial, then sets it back down. They notice tiny footsteps in the dust, that lead to the last remaining door, and it is open.

Cut to Kigee and Borris, we see A double swinging door, an oak door, and a window. We choose the oak door and find it locked. Borris attacks the door handle, and fails to crack the lock. Kigee runs to the swinging doors and peeks out the windows and sees a big dinning room table but no people. She mimics Borris to get him to come over, but as we try to enter the dining room, we are hit with the most putrid smell and go to the window. It opens easily, without a squeak. Fresh air washes over us and we take a big breath, before the two of them exit. We are in a graveyard with a mausoleum, and Kigee points to the mausoleum. As we are walking around, there is an open door that seems to return to the main area. We see the door on the left is open, and the door at the back is also open. We can see multiple sets of footprints going to the store room, then to the 3rd and final door. We rejoin Diedrik and meet Thalindra.

After a quick introduction, we head to the mausoleum and see a big handle. Thalindra, Borris, and Diedrik open the door together. As Thalindra steps in, Borris recognizes the names on the tombs, Sergey and some chick, relatives of Strahd. Thalindra and Borris push open the caskets to reveal stairs that head down. Kigee heads down first. When she turns out to motion the others to follow, and she trips and falls backwards, coming face-to-face with the creepy wooden doll. It's mouth opens and shoots Kigee, causing her to fall unconscious. Thalindra pulls the dart from Kigees neck and kicks the doll. Borris tightly grabs the doll, and it begins moving in his hands. He wants to burn it, but Diedrik stops him. Thalindra takes the doll by the hair and takes it to the sarcophagus. They give the book to the doll, and the doll casts a spell to reawaken Strahd. Strahd picks up Kigee, and exits the mausoleum, eventually jostling her awake. Strahd enters the back door and into one of 2 doors in the hall, moving into a bath house. It's large and multitub made out of marble. What's left in the tubs is not water, congealed pools of old blood. 3 Women emaciated are crawling around. Strahd's old wives. He puts the wives out of their misery. We stroll through the bathhouse and find a vault. Inside is an armory with weapons and armor. Kigee grabs some leather armor and changes back into a human, putting on the armor. Borris grabs a dagger and his body turns to dust as his soul seemingly seeps into the dagger.
