200 people town called Tinzk, new town founded after Strahd dead, situated on the border of a forest, next to the Luna river. To the south a shortways is another body of water. It has been 100 years since Strahd von Zarovich has been killed. We are in the land of Barovia. Since the death of Strahd, the mist in the area is easing. The sky is no longer full of clouds. Land is recovering and things are turning green. The horrors of the land remain. One doesn't travel outside at night. There are werewolves, scarecrows, and more. Most of the people that live here are human. Warforged is not allowed. Allowance for lycanthropy, only exist as wereRaven or werewolf. Raven is a specific family you can marry into but not out of. Secret people. Overlooking the town and across the river is a large ruined castle. Home of the silver dragon and knights, Strahd killed everyone and zombified the dragon. Powers of the land are still alive, There is a god of the land St. Markovia. Barovian and Vistani (gypsy) type of humans. Since Strahd's demise, the gypsy folk have begun settling down in permanent camps near big cities. Vistani are considered in high regard. If a different race, need to be a failed adventurer brought to Brovia. Possibly giving you further knowledge of other gods or stories. Age appropriate of 17 or 18. Regular town teens.
