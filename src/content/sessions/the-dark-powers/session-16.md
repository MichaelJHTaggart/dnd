After a restful night, we head to blow the Ol' Bonegrinder with Abraham's first ever stick of dynamite. Kigee flies inside from the upper broken window to make sure there are no more people. She pulls out a twisted egg that was left behind from Thalindra's mother. What was originally thought to be a "failed" egg, it gives off this horrid vibe of evil, and we see claw marks like something dug it's way out of the egg. Concerned, Kigee brings it out to show everyone, and Abraham goes into set the dynamite in place. The party moves to blow the place up. Everyone gets 120 ft back, with Kigee 50 ft in the air flying to watch, and we get hit with the rubble that goes flying. Holy heck this blast is huge! Massive chunks of rock and debri fly everyone. Kigee gets knocked to the ground and Thalindra heals Kigee and herself from their injuries. The party returns to the tower where we find the man who is supposed to be farming. He asks for poo for fertilizer. We don't have any, Diedrik tries to find the poo he desires (bat poo), but it seems to be in the werewolf cave in the north. So Kigee calls forth local ravens, who proceed to poo on the man and the fields. He's pissed. Before running inside Diedrik dumps 10 gal of water on him to try to wash him off but only succeeded in pissing him off more. Kigee follows him inside to try and calm him down, and find the children openly laughing at him covered in poo. Hoorah! Poo therapy! Next we help Abraham find more items to make more bombs. Abraham suceeds in making another stick of dynamite. Towards the end of the day, Kigee asks Strahd about how to get past the blood tests, and he is like "bro just fly" so she sneaks out and heads straight to the button shop. Causes a muck there ending in the passing of some wild Ravens (the savages!) and Kigee flies back to the tower with her shitty button she stole. 

We discuss next steps and decide to try to find Thalindra's mom to get some answers. We find in that book that they had a cabin, located at Tser Falls, and agree to head out tomorrow (next session).
