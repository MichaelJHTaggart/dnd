We regroup after the fight, and discuss the safety of keeping the pumpkin head with us. It mentions that they were under the control of the Satyrs, and with the Satyrs dead, it has attached to Thalindra who has named it dopey. Dopey gives a peace offering of buttons to Kigee, who accepts the payment. We return to Barovia to rest. During the night, Kigee returns to the Wizards of Wines to answer the summons of her father, escorted by her uncles that they saw the day before. She was "scolded" by her father, and received a new task, deliver precious wine to Strahd. In return, Kigee gifted her parents the buttons given to her by the pumpkin head. Eventually, she returned to her hotel room in Barovia, glancing in Thalindra's room after hearing weird taps on the wood, finding the pumpkin head sprouted roots and was guarding Thalindra in her sleep. Upon waking, Kigee gave Strahd the wine, with an agreement to visit. We use a flying rug to quickly get to the back of the castle, where we can see things have changed greatly here. We get shot down by a flower, destroying the rug. Diedrik asks about Thalindra's past, and she confesses she doesn't have much memory, but remembers her father and doesn't believe he was a nice man. Diedrik then trauma dumps on Thalindra and agrees to help her find her old home. Using the pumpkin head as a lantern, they descend down a back stairway. We stumble into a giant centaur named Archie, who seems to know who Strahd is. After a short conversation, and a warning to watch for things that bite, he turns into a large cloud of butterflies and flies away. We enter the Armory, and Strahd pulls Diedrik to the side for a private conversation, and Kigee listens in. Diedrik receives a canine necklace that prevents the transfer of his were-curse, as well as a coin that will remove the curse if he wishes.

Kigee interrupts in the convo, and asks if Strahd has any more of the necklaces. He opens a drawer full of black raven feathers, admitting that he once hated all were creatures, and tried to erraticate them all. He gives all the feathers to Kigee, and they all prevent the spread of the wereraven curse. Diedrik and Kigee have a moment of connection, warming some of their previous grievances. Thalindra receives a vial that helps her aim and a light crossbow, and a sparkly magic girl wand (magic missile). Abraham receives something that I wasn't quick enough to write down. Dopey carved a hole through the back gate, and we are just exiting the back of the castle to head for Van Richten's Tower.
