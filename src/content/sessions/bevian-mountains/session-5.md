The heroes have been surrounded by darkness for a full 2 days when they set eyes on the light of Svedala. The beauty of the city could not be understated. The white, clear crystals have deep veins into the earth so that they protrude here in the ceiling. The light from the surface refacting all the way down here so there is a sort of dim daylight here. A bridge is before the adventurers over a massive and deep cravase. Above the bridge is a massive and beautiful chandelier made out of the crstyals, that is seemingly placed to catch all of the light that exists beautifully sharing as much as the light throughout the city. 

The heroes are taken to the main hall with the dwarf. Throughout the city they have many dwarves. They hear an argument at the main hall from the cheiftan and the religious leader. The cheiftan wants to stay secluded, and the religious leader wants to expand.
