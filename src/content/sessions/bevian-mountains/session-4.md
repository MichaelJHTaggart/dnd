The dwarf admonishes the heroes to be traversing outside the mountains, and lets them know that they are lucky that he came along. The mountains are not safe, and they are deadly to traverse outside due to the Ice Giants. 

He provides them with some of his magical items. A rapier in particular seems to be quite strange and powerful. Our heroes discover it is the [Rapier of Shar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1494713-rapier-of-shar) and believe it to be cursed, a risky but powerful item. 

He provides 2 directions. 3 days by the "safe" route, and 1 day on a more dangerous route to get to the city of Svedala. The city the heroes have heard about!

The heroes chose the dangerous route, and deftly get through the goblin's village using the cloak provided by the dwarf. The caves are well made by dwarven hands.
