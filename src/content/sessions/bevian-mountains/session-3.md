The adventurers begin traveling to the mountain. They soon find that they are being tracked by a band of bandits. They deal with the bandits and question one before releasing him. He let's them know that he works for The Black Bandit, and they are supposed to return goods they steal to him for exchange for some of the profits.

The heroes continue on. They encounter some wild goats and deal with a particularly aggressive large goat that attacks.

They continue on up and down the foothills until the come to the base of the mountain. As they near the base of the mountain they see a huge white figure walking on the mountainside just up the mountain. Shocked they freeze, and suddenly they are thrown down with a creature falling ontop of them with some kind of blanket urgently uttering,"Don't move or make sound until the Giant passes."

It feels like an eternity, but the figure eventually stirs ontop of them to collect the cloak. It's a dwarf. He says urgently,"You must follow me now or they will find you and hunt you down." 

He walks toward some rocks, and ducks into a crevice into the base of the mountain.

The heroes follow, and are soon safely in the tunnels under the mountain.
