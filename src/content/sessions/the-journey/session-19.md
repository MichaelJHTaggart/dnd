Tell guard giving dayquon agis food. Take a left, and looking for a male servant with a silver sash. "I wish to clean the armor of a great warrior someday" Aye or Nay. Castle is swarming with paladins. Grovel to paladins. Norlis Sittle, head servant, takes his job seriously, must avoid. Norlis looks like a snob with a gold sash. "Holy order of lathendar" and "Holy order of eldath" are the two factions fighting in the tunnels. 

Underground river lets out on the right of the castle in some bushes. Go out the same way we came in otherwise. Watch ends in 8 hours, make sure to let the guards swap, within an hour of their shift. 

Fulmar is a noble of Tantlehood.
