We start up by traveling across fields and come across an Abbey that has no roads leading to it. There are villagers in the fields that are looking scraggly and starved. Abernath reconizes one of them, named Jeffery who had a pet allegator. Jeffery is freaked out because it's against the rules to talk to people. We hear a booming voice that beckons us to the Abbey. An old wizard named Eslick approaches the group and beckons them in. Toes was Toes, asked about shiny stuff and was kicked out. Horus and Abernath go inside and learn some new spells, Toes stays outside and causes trouble (buries a ball in the field, stealing balls from other workers).

Abernath and Horus are going to try and convince the wizards to build a prison. Picking up first on Toes.
