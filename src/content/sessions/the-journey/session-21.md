Party splits, toes goes to the apothacary, Abernath goes to the magic shop, Horus goes to our planned meeting spot at a big oak tree outside of town. Abernath enters the magic shop, gives up the crown and receives the portable hole and the bag of tricks.

Toes gets a minute away to the apothecary, passes a young boy running to the castle. Bells began to toll and a gate is heard in the distance. Toes sprints to the apothecary and gets the record books from Albert. She sprints to the tree where she meets with the others.

The group travels away from the town. Toes plays with her bag of tricks on the travels. Night falls, Abernath digs a hole and Horus casts the tiny hut in the hole. Abernath checks out his new portal hole and sees Neth. Toes and Horus look through the ledgers from the apothacary.

Avamerious the third <- potential poisoner based on ledgers
Toes pulls out a lion out of here bag of tricks and breaks the tiny hut spell, they get slightly buried. Fix everything and lion stands watch outside. 1 hour later, lion wakes up group, is killed by the Drow. Group sets up watches for the rest of the night. Abernath>Horus>Toes is the order.
