description: "The heroes discover strife within the city of Thaumagarten"
---
Traveling for a few days, the group arrives at Thaumagarten. Toes steals carrots and eats them as they travel to the main city. Shepley hushly talks to Abernath about a book. Castle of Thaumagarten and Centahaven linked by tunnels, heavily guarded. Both cities controlled by rivaling gangs, the tunnels connecting the cities possibly used for smuggling. They are guarded by henchmen of the nobles. 

Someone was supposed to tail Garo, he's missing. The heroes need to find Garo for The Black Bandit. It looks like the bedroom window was forced open. Dismus is Garo's tail possibly pickpocketing at the castle. To get into the gangs, The Black Bandit let's them know that they will have to talk to the servants. Agnus (an old servant lady at market that prepared Garo's meals). Horus and Shepley are going to talk to her, while Toes and Abernath talk to Dismus.
