The heroes arrive in Oberlot, and are shocked to see that in the tavern, serving them, is the slaver man they met on the dock so long ago. They are immediately on-guard; However, the man seems to not recognize them at all. His name is different, but his face is unmistakenable. It is the same man. 

They discover by talking to several people that he was found on the outskirts of the White Crystal Forest, without any knowledge of who he was. He was a pleasant, generous, and good man. The heroes make a difficult choice to turn him in to the Tauren Kingdom authorities for the atrocities he committed on the otherside of the mountain. They identify who he is, to the authorities who make the arrest. 

The heroes meet a man who is in need of protection on his journey to Tantlehood. They agree to the service, and set sail with the man to go to Tantlehood.
