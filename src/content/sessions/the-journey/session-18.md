Horus and Shepley talk to Agnus regarding Garo. Agnus is surprised Garo is missing (possibly not kidnapper). Mentions that Garo has been reading about elves and the blue crystal forest having magical crystals. Also mentioned a strange visitor from the castle, a paladin asking about dragon armor. also said that his neighbor's cat peed in his house :( bad kitty. They leave Agnus. 

Switch to Toes and Abernath, they don't blatantly see Dismus, so Toes pickpockets from a few suspicious looking people and tricks/invites them to meet us at the Tavern tonight, hopefully to narrow down who Dismus is. 

Switch to Shepley and Horus, they discuss the dragon armor as Horus wasn't present for the elf wizard. 

Switch to Toes and Abernath, they check the next two of the 4 suspicious folks and determine that they aren't Dismus. Toes tries to steal on the way back to the tavern and messes up. They meet with Shepley and Horus at the tavern. They discuss the armor and the possibilities of what could happen. Toes confronts Shepley about hurting her feelings, and the group chats it out, Toes confesses she isn't a blessing of the hunt.

They meet with Dismus and learn very little about what else could be happening. The group retreat to Abernath's room. Abernath tells the party about the crown. 

Afterwords, Shepley retreats to his room while Abernath reads Tale of Peter Rabbit to Toes and Horus. 

Shepley runs into the Black Bandit and his partner Amaruk. They bring him food and wine to talk to him about what he has learned so far and have a private discussion in his room. Shepley is paralyzed by the drink and abducted.

Amaruk turns into a werewolf and bites Shepley, cursing him with lycanthropy. The Black Bandit and Amaruk then use a portal to transport the now suffering Shepley to a festival in Fuath's honor. Shepley's suffering of the lycanthropy curse is apart of the entertainment for the celebration.
