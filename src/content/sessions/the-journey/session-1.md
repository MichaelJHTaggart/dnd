You have been searching out a place in need of your skills for employment. You have just exited the frozen tundra of Xxar, and entered into an aired land that has steep hills and mountains. You believe that you may have arrived in the outskirts of Svedala due to the landscape. Unfortunately, you haven't heard much said about the inhabitants and the news of this land. However, you have been told that the town centre of Svedala is bustling with work, and is always in need of someone of your skills.
You climb to the top of a tall hill and take a look around to try and spot the city. Just foothills... as far as you can see. 

Its overcast, but not uncomfortably cold. It feels like fall or spring, but the clouds are high and away from you. You look behind you, and remember it is about a days journey to Xxar. Recalling your adventure through the land, you ran into a few friendly ice gnomes, but the main city seemed to give you the cold shoulder. Turning to the front you see before you rolling hills, plains, filled with their brown prairie grass to walk on. It does make the terrain a more comfortable hike. You also notice large veins of some clear stone. These massive rocks are located everywhere and they are completely transparent and smooth the the touch. They seem to all to be very large and deep into the ground. You pick a loose piece from the ground and gaze at it for a while.

To the left you can just make out tall sand dunes that block your view of the Tvett Ocean, you estimate that it would take about two days to reach those dunes. Looking to your right you take in the huge majesty of the Bjorn mountains. There is snow capped on the tops of the peaks and trapped in various crevices of the massive mountain range. You wonder what might be on the other side of the massive mountain range. You estimate that somewhere between where you are and where the mountains are you should find the city of Svedala. You feel like you are completely alone, with no signs of any life anywhere, but from what you heard you should be practically at the gates of Svedala. You think it is very unlikely that there is civilization existing between you and the mountains, but it is hard to see around the hills and valleys that possibly lie before you.
