Hero's come to Branslare looking for work. They each independently hear someone asking for adventurers help. They follow the man into an alley where they are ambushed. Defeating the would be attackers, they are invited by a passing dwarven guard to help escort a chest to the Blue Crystal Forest.

The hero's agree and are begin to make their journey as guards.
