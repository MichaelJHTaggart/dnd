The heroes flee from the frogs. They encounter people living in the marshes and warn them of what they have done, and the goal of the frogs. The people gather their widespread kin in the marshes, and travel with the heroes who offer them protection. They are attacked several times throughout this process, but don't lose a single person. 

They make it just outside Oberlot where they see they are no longer being pursued by the frogs. 

The people are homeless, and have lost all of their way of life. They have nothing of much value with them to help them get the necessary items they need to survive. Shepley gives the people a jewel studded scabbard that they retrieved from the frog people. This gives them plenty to be able to start anew whereever they may go. They are deeply grateful for all of their help. 

The heroes travel to Oberlot.
