While Shepley is recovering for several days, Abernath returns to Destius' body and buries him and the other two men with proper burial rights. He also recovers the large amount of gold that the man they were supposed to guard was carrying.

When returning to the apothocary in-town he finds a large lion creature with a cresent moon on his forehead dressed in full plate armor guarding Shepley. Abernath asks who he is, and what he was doing. Leon answers that he was told in a dream to protect Shepley, and arrived here to complete this mission.

Abernath splits the gold with Shepley, and they keep some of the venomus bolts.
