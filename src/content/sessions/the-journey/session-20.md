Abernath reads Br'er Rabbit and the Tar Baby to Toes before they decide to sleep for the night. In the morning, theres a bussle down stairs, the queen has died. 

Toes lifts a satchel, while Abernath is listening to the gossip about the queen. They group goes up stairs and discuss what to do next. Toes get's kicked out of the room and goes steals a child's necklace. 

As the group leaves the inn, they pass the child bawling and the father trying to sooth him. Abernath tries to console the child by "bringing back his mother" and raised the dead. The city panicked and ran away, before a mob is heard approaching. Abernath goes invisible, Toes hides, and Horus just walks out of the cemetary. 

Mob gets pissed at Horus. Toes tries to save the people from Horus by screaming "run Zombie!!" and pulls Horus away. Mob tries to grab Horus, he uses burning hands and kills 20 people. Horus and Toes retreats towards the apothecary and Toes stealthed (rolled 19).
