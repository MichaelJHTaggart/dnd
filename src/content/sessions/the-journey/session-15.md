We suppose we have a two day lead after sprinting for a ridiculous amount of time. It's morning, Toes gathers food, Shepley says a prayer, we gather our horses and continue where we find a path/road. It's a beautiful day, Shepley gets an anxiety attack and sees dark smoke in the distance, he has a flashback of his childhood. He points out the smoke to the group, and they rush forward to see if they can help. Looks like a town that has been ambushed, by goblins or something that used goblin arrows. Shepley has flashbacks of the Dead Eye Tribe goblins that attacked his own town.
