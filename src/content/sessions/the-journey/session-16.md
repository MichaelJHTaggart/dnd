Goblins are either killed or run out of town. Group loots supplies from the goblin camp. Horus eats poisonous food and is amazingly fine. The group travels on for a few days to reach a town. Toes dresses as a small village girl and pretends Horus is her grandpa. Shepley kills a boar and feeds the inn. Toes steals a bracelet and some money from a drunk guy, then rearranges the shelves in the general store. No bag of holding is to be found here, and the group decides the next best course of action will be to continue onto Thaumagarten to sell the armour and find magical items.
