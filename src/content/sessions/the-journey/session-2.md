After completing their armed escort duties and receiving payment. The heroes begin their journey to the nearest town. They are ambushed, though hopelessly outnumbered Destius valiantly runs the lead man through before being overwhelmed and put into chains. They are taken to a slaving ship nearby. That night as Destius comes too they find themselves chained below the main deck. 

The party collectively rolls a series of 18s, 19s, and 20s, to successfully get out of their bonds, retrieve their equipment, sneak through their deck level, Oil the stairs to the main deck, lower a rowboat without being seen, heard or caught, lighting the boat on fire while simultaneously escaping. Leaving the large ship in a fiery chaos as they successfully make their daring escape. They make it to land in a few hours of hard rowing, full confidence that they have not been spotted by the ship at all. 

They travel to Yellowroth, and in a few days make their way to the city. They find that the city is hopelessly divided between a ruthless gang, and slavers. Word of the slaving ship being severely burnt coming into port a few days ago for repairs was circulating around the taverns, with much support from the gang. The heroes immediately leave the city in fear of encountering any slavers that might recognize them. They make their way across the Bevian Mountains.
