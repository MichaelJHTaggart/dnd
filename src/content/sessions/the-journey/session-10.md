---

In the forest the heros see skeletons begin to animate. The heroes take action and begin to fight. They kill 2 of them to start. Shepley gets downed. Leon grabs Shepley and begins to flee with the group. Abernath is stuck in tree, pulling Skeleton's focus. Leon saves Shepley. Abernath kills 2 more while in tree. Toes enters the fight and hides to observe. Toes sees the 3 and distracts 6 with a bell, while 8 remain around Leon. Group kills off the rest, Toes loops around and rejoins the other 3. They meet and introductions are made, stories are shared. Shepley believes Toes has been sent as a blessing by the god of the Hunt. Abernath finds the bird the group was hunting for before Toes joined. After a short rest, Toes mentions she didn't kill the 6 she lured off, and Shepley begins to track them with the group in tow (rolled 17 to track).
