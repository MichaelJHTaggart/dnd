The heroes arrive in Tantlehood and make arrangements to travel by horse as guard for the man. After a days journey out of the city the heroes have a campfire set up and are enjoying the evening. Suddenly whistle, a thunk, and the man they are to protect falls over gasping for air, and dies within moments. Two men on horse back trot up with crossbows at the ready.

> "Nobody move. Our quarrel isn't with you. This man stole that bag full of gold he carries from our master, and we are here to retrieve it."

Shepley ignores their demands, and moves towards the campfire. Combat begins. A bolt is fired at Shepley and hits him. Shepley struggles for breath as he barely fights off a powerful venom, unable to do anything more, he is prone struggling for breath. Destius attacks the man that fired at Shepley. Destius is hit with a bolt from the other man, and fails to fight off the venom. With only his last breath of air left he attacks, and successfully dispatches one of the men. Abernath finishes off the last remaining man. Abernath rushes to Destius' side, and witnesses his last moments of life slip away. Seeing there is still time for Shepley he rides hard to get Shepley to the apothocary in town. They are able to concoct an antidote with the bolts of venom that Abernath brings.
