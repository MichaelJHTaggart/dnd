The heroes encounter a frog people on their way to Wintergulch. They intend to keep the heroes prisoner until they are persuaded to let them defeat their enemy the creature that eats them that lives in Wintergulch itself. An agreement is made, if the heroes defeat the evil in Wintergulch the frog people will let them go. 

The heroes arrive at Wintergulch and they encounter an odd viny creation that seems like a large sentient plant. 

It seems to be living here, and eating mostly local life. The heroes fight it and defeat it. They search the area finding 2 magical rings for armor, and talking to animals. It seems that this place has been ransacked before. As they leave Wintergulch they are ambushed by frog people who take Shepley and Destius captive while Abernath turns invisible and follows.

They are taken to the main court where the king and leader of the frogs sits on a throne. They find that all of the gold, armor, weapons, from Wintergulch are covered in muck and slime here in the living area of these frog people. Shepley and Destius attempt to negotiate letting the king know that they killed the beast in Wintergulch. The frog king is pleased and looks forward to expanding his empire now that the threat is gone. It is clear that he is a bully, and possess no great skill himself.

Abernath creates a distraction and causes the frogs to run in fear as they are cowards. The group grabs as many items as they can carry, and runs before the frogs can recover.
