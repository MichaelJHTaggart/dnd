As the group breaks the Tiny Hut, a green death fog surrounds the area. Toes bursts from the hole and the fog, to come face to face with three drow. She dramatically steps back into the fog and kills one with her bow. Abernath throws his voice across the pit to mimic the sound of one of the drow as an attempt to distract. As he runs out of the hole, he dumps out his bag of holding and send the skeletons to attack. More drow come out, making a current total of 5 visible, one being the leader and one being a mage. Horus casually leaves the fog (immune to poison) and throws a fireball at the mage. More fighting! The heroes kill all of the drow. Horus finds a staff, Toes doesn't find shiny stuff. Abernath casts detect magic and Horus uses Identify. They have a "Sky blinders staff". Abernath buries the bodies and all three "pray" over them. Upon discussing next location, Abernath and Horus try to show Toes that Shepley is likely deceased. Toes prays to Fuath who responds and tells her that Shepley is with him now, which pleases her.
