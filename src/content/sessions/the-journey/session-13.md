Leon leaves, Toes names Abernaths skeletons "Maple" and "Stone". Abernath detects magic and checks the map to track the items we were previously hunting. Toes catches Shepley up on the history of what happened, talking for an hour straight and Abernath working hard to ignore them. Arrived at the magic items location and get attacked by a snake. It retreats into it's burrow with its babies, Toes goes into the hole. After a battle, snakes are dead and 3 magical items are found, "Archer's Prize (Shepley), Armoured Circlet (Abernath)" are both rings, and "Wand Sheath"(Abernath). Roleplay commences, group decides to start to head to Thaumagarten.

Toes considers making name tags for the skeletons, potentially full outfits.
