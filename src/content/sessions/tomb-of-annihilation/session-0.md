Our adventurers gather in Port Nyanzaru, each drawn by the rumors of a deadly curse affecting the world. As they share their stories in a local tavern, they learn of the death curse's true nature - those who have been raised from the dead are slowly wasting away, and no magic can restore the dead to life.
