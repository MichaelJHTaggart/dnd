You have been searching out a place in need of your skills for adventuring employment. You have just exited the frozen tundra of Xxar, and entered into an aired land that has steep foothills and the looming Bevian mountains ahead.

Wait, you have heard someone mention this landscape to you before! What was it? Sve--.... the name escapes you, but you remember someone saying of a town bustling with work. 

You climb a foothill to look around. Nothing. All you see are looming foothills and the great Bevian mountains...
